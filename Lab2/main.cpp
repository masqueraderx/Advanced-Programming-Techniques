Description:
The purpose of this file is to complete a class called MyGrid
that has a member variable gridElements that is a dynamic two-dimensional
array of elements (type long) of m rows by n columns. To run this file,
you need to input input1.txt input2.txt, and it will output a file
Lab2Output.txt.
The main.cpp file is provided for you to test your classâ€™s functionality.
