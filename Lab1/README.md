In this Lab, we have to handle three problems. Note that this Lab is just an introduction to C++ Programming. 
  1. Summation of Primes
  There are many solutions, and I just chose simple one, that is to check whether there's a divisor before N when checking N. It's content in IsPrime.
  When compiling, use g++ Lab1_Problem1.cpp, note that you have to set parameter when running, like./ a.out 100.
  
  2. Collatz Sequence
  This Program is used for Summation of resulting Collatz Sequence. To use it, you need to input a number, 
  and then it will output the summation of Collatz Sequence. And remember to input a value when running.
