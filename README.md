This is a Georgia Institute of Technology ECE6122 homework. It mainly uses C++ to do different fields programming.
1. Basic C++ 
2. Objected-Oriented Programming (Classes)
3. Multi-threads
4. OpenGL
5. Sockets

The environment I used is MAC OS and the plantform is Clion. If it needs some special attention to compile on Liunx System, I will mark it in each folder.
